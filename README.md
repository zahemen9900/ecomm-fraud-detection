# E-commerce Fraud Detection

A machine learning project aimed at detecting fraudulent transactions in e-commerce platforms.

## Overview

This project uses machine learning algorithms to identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activities in e-commerce transactions. By analyzing transaction data, user behavior, and other relevant features, the system helps businesses reduce financial losses and improve security.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Real-time fraud detection capabilities
- Performance metrics and visualization
